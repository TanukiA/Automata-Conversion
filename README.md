## Automata-Conversion

This is a JavaFX application which provides a set of conversion functions for Finite Automata. 

This system will first take the regular grammar as input, either from text file import or direct typing and use it to generate a finite automaton. The 4 conversion tasks involved are: 
1. convert regular grammar to NFA
2. ε-NFA to NFA without ε-transitions
3. NFA to DFA
4. DFA minimization

Tables will be updated to show each conversion output. After all these conversions, the system also provides a function of string testing to inform users on whether each string inputted is accepted or rejected by the machine.
