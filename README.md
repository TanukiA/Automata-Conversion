## Conversion of Regular Grammar to Finite Automata

This is a JavaFX application which provide a set of conversion functions for Finite Automata. 

This system will first take the regular grammar as input, either from text file import or direct typing and use it to generate a finite automaton. The 4 conversion tasks involved are: convert regular grammar to NFA, ε-NFA to NFA without ε-transitions, NFA to DFA and DFA minimization. After all these conversions, the system also provides a function of string testing to inform users on whether each string inputted is accepted or rejected by the machine.
